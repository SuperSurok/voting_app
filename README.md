### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

There are a ton of powerful features weâ€™ve yet to go over, yet all of them build upon the core fundamentals we just covered:

We think about and organize our React apps as components
Using JSX inside the render method
Data flows from parent to children through props
Event flows from children to parent through functions
Utilizing React lifecycle methods
Stateful components and how state is different from props
How to manipulate state while treating it as immutable.
